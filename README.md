🙋‍♂️ About Me

🎓 I'm a third-year Software Engineering undergraduate at the Informatics Institute of Technology, Sri Lanka, affiliated with the University of Westminster, UK.

💻 I’m passionate about building real-world, user-focused applications — from mobile apps and interactive web platforms to backend systems. I'm currently strengthening my skills in Java, Kotlin, Flutter, HTML, CSS, and React.

📱 I enjoy turning simple ideas into smooth, functional interfaces, and I’m also interested in mobile-first development and clean UI/UX design.

🚀 I’m currently working on improving my core programming skills, contributing to group projects, and gaining hands-on experience to prepare for an internship in the software industry.

🎯 My goal is to become a skilled full-stack or mobile developer, and to grow by working on impactful, real-world projects that push me out of my comfort zone.
